            content: `Hot take: Documentation is just as important as the code itself üìù

I've been reviewing some legacy projects lately, and the difference between well-documented and poorly documented code is night and day.

Good documentation:
‚Ä¢ Saves hours of debugging time
‚Ä¢ Makes onboarding new team members seamless  
‚Ä¢ Prevents "what was I thinking?" moments
‚Ä¢ Shows you care about your future self

Yet so many developers treat it as an afterthought. Write docs like your job depends on it - because it might!

What's your approach to documentation? Do you write it as you code or after?
