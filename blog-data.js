There's something magical about starting the day with both physical and mental exercise. Today I:

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 5km run along the beach
üíª Fixed 3 critical bugs in our production app
‚òï Perfected my cold brew recipe
üìö Read 2 chapters of "Clean Architecture"

The combination of endorphins and problem-solving puts me in the perfect flow state. What's your morning routine like?

I've been reviewing some legacy projects lately, and the difference between well-documented and poorly documented code is night and day.

Good documentation:
‚Ä¢ Saves hours of debugging time
‚Ä¢ Makes onboarding new team members seamless  
‚Ä¢ Prevents "what was I thinking?" moments
‚Ä¢ Shows you care about your future self

Yet so many developers treat it as an afterthought. Write docs like your job depends on it - because it might!

What's your approach to documentation? Do you write it as you code or after?

After months of research and saving up, I've created the perfect coding sanctuary. Here's what made the biggest difference:

üñ•Ô∏è Dual 4K monitors (game changer for productivity)
‚å®Ô∏è Mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches
ü™ë Ergonomic chair that doesn't destroy my back
üå± Plants everywhere for that oxygen boost
üéß Noise-canceling headphones for deep focus
üí° Ambient LED lighting that adjusts with time of day

The investment was worth every penny. My productivity has skyrocketed and coding feels like a joy rather than a grind.

Swipe to see the before and after! What's in your ideal setup?
