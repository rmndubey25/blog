# Personal Blog Application

## Overview

This is a static personal blog application that mimics a Twitter-like interface for displaying blog posts and profile information. The application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a modern social media-style personal blog without requiring a backend server or database.

## System Architecture

The application follows a **client-side only architecture** with no backend dependencies:

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: Static JavaScript configuration file (`blog-data.js`)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Twitter-inspired dark theme
- **Icons**: Feather Icons via CDN
- **Images**: External URLs (Unsplash for demo content)

## Key Components

### 1. Static Data Layer (`blog-data.js`)
- **Purpose**: Central configuration file containing all blog content and profile information
- **Structure**: JavaScript object with profile data and posts array
- **Rationale**: Eliminates need for database while maintaining easy content management

### 2. User Interface (`index.html`)
- **Layout**: Twitter-inspired design with header, profile section, and content area
- **Components**: Avatar, cover photo, profile metadata, navigation tabs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts

### 3. Application Logic (`script.js`)
- **BlogApp Class**: Main application controller managing state and interactions
- **Features**: Tab switching, post rendering, interaction handling
- **Icon Management**: Feather Icons initialization and replacement

### 4. Styling (`styles.css`)
- **Theme**: Dark mode Twitter-like interface
- **Typography**: System font stack for native feel
- **Layout**: Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive design
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states and smooth transitions

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: BlogApp class loads and processes data from `blog-data.js`
2. **Rendering**: Posts and profile information are dynamically inserted into DOM
3. **Interactions**: User clicks trigger state changes and UI updates
4. **Updates**: All changes are handled client-side with JavaScript

## External Dependencies

- **Feather Icons**: CDN-hosted icon library for consistent UI elements
- **Unsplash**: External image hosting for demo post images
- **System Fonts**: Leverages native font stacks for optimal performance

**Rationale**: Minimal external dependencies ensure fast loading and reduce potential points of failure.

**Advantages**:
- No server maintenance required
